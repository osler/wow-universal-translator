Back in... wow, when was this?  2005?  I had thought of a clever hack to allow for cross-faction communication.  I wrote it, released it, found some other people who wanted to contribute new "languages" to the project and it ended up becoming the Universal Translator: the first WoW plugin using only Lua and their API to be banned from use.

They've long since removed the exploitable elements that allowed this to work, and I've long since stopped playing WoW: but I figured I might as well put this out there in case anyone wanted to see the source for this old plugin.
